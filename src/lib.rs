//! # Background
//!
//! Given how widely algorithmic requirements can vary, `float_eq` explores the
//! idea that there are no generally sensible default margins for comparisons.
//! This is in contrast to the approach taken by many existing crates, which often
//! provide default epsilon values in checks or implicitly favour particular
//! algorithms. The author's hope is that by exposing the inherent complexity in
//! a uniform way, programmers will find it easier to develop an intuition for how
//! to write effective comparisons. The trade-off is that each individual
//! comparison requires more iteration time and thought.
//!
//! And yes, this is yet another crate built on the principles described in *that*
//! Random ASCII [floating point comparison] article, which is highly recommended
//! background reading ðŸ™‚.
//!
//! # Making comparisons
//!
//! The [`float_eq!`] and [`float_ne!`] macros compare two floating point
//! expressions for equality based on the result of one or more different kinds
//! of check. Each check is invoked by name and an upper boundary, so for example
//! `rel <= 0.1`, should be read as *"a [relative epsilon comparison](#relative-epsilon-comparison)
//! with a maximum difference of less than or equal to `0.1`"*. If multiple checks
//! are provided then they are executed in order from left to right, shortcutting
//! to return early if one passes. The corresponding [`assert_float_eq!`] and
//! [`assert_float_ne!`] use the same interface:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use float_eq::{assert_float_eq, assert_float_ne, float_eq, float_ne};
//! use std::f32;
//!
//! assert!(float_eq!(1000.0_f32, 1000.0002, ulps <= 4));
//!
//! const ROUNDING_ERROR: f32 = 0.00034526698; // f32::EPSILON.sqrt()
//! assert!(float_ne!(4.0_f32, 4.1, rel <= ROUNDING_ERROR));
//!
//! const RECIP_REL_EPSILON: f32 = 0.00036621094; // 1.5 * 2_f32.powi(-12)
//! assert_float_eq!(0.1_f32.recip(), 10.0, rel <= RECIP_REL_EPSILON);
//!
//! assert_float_ne!(0.0_f32, 0.0001, abs <= 0.00005, ulps <= 4);
//! ```
//!
//! Arrays of `FloatEq` compatible types are also supported, from size 0 to 32
//! (inclusive):
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use float_eq::{assert_float_eq, assert_float_ne, float_eq, float_ne};
//! assert_float_eq!([1.0000001_f32, 2.0], [1.0, 2.0], ulps <= 1);
//! ```
//!
//! The ideal choice of comparison will vary on a case by case basis, and depends
//! on the input range and error margins of the expressions to be compared. For
//! example, a test of the result of [finite difference approximation of
//! derivatives] might use a relative epsilon check with a `max_diff` of the `sqrt`
//! of machine epsilon, whereas a test of the SSE [`_mm_rcp_ps` operation] could
//! instead opt for a maximum relative error of `1.5 * 2^(-12)` based on the
//! available documentation. Algorithm stability can play a big part in the size
//! of these margins, and it can be worth seeing if code might be rearranged to
//! reduce loss of precision if you find yourself using large bounds.
//!
//! Relative comparisons (`ulps` and `rel`) are usually a good choice for comparing
//! [normal floats] (e.g. when [`f32::is_normal`] is true). However, they become
//! far too strict for comparisons of very small numbers with zero, where the
//! relative differences are very large but the absolute difference is tiny. This
//! is where you might choose to use an absolute epsilon (`abs`) comparison instead.
//! There are also potential performance implications based on the target hardware.
//!
//! Be prepared to research, test, benchmark and iterate on your comparisons. The
//! [floating point comparison] article which informed this crate's implementation
//! is a good place to start.
//!
//! ## Absolute epsilon comparison
//!
//! A check to see how far apart two expressions are by comparing the absolute
//! difference between them to an absolute, unscaled epsilon. Equivalent to, using
//! `f32` as an example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn float_eq_abs(a: f32, b: f32, max_diff: f32) -> bool {
//!     (a - b).abs() <= max_diff
//! }
//! # float_eq::assert_float_eq!(4_f32, 4.0000025, abs <= 0.0000025);
//! # assert!(float_eq_abs(4_f32, 4.0000025, 0.0000025));
//! ```
//!
//! Absolute epsilon tests *do not* work well for general floating point comparison,
//! because they do not take into account that floating point values' precision
//! changes with their magnitude. Thus `max_diff` must be very specific and
//! dependent on the exact values being compared:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use float_eq::{assert_float_eq, assert_float_ne};
//! let a = 1.0;
//! let b = 1.0000001; // the next representable value above 1.0
//! assert_float_eq!(a, b, abs <= 0.0000002);             // equal
//! assert_float_ne!(a * 4.0, b * 4.0, abs <= 0.0000002); // not equal
//! assert_float_eq!(a * 4.0, b * 4.0, abs <= 0.0000005); // equal
//! ```
//!
//! Whereas a relative epsilon comparison could cope with this since it scales by
//! the size of the largest input parameter:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use float_eq::{assert_float_eq, assert_float_ne};
//! # let a = 1.0;
//! # let b = 1.0000001;
//! assert_float_eq!(a, b, rel <= 0.0000002);
//! assert_float_eq!(a * 4.0, b * 4.0, rel <= 0.0000002);
//! ```
//!
//! However, absolute epsilon comparison is often the best choice when comparing
//! values directly against zero, especially when those values have undergone
//! [catastrophic cancellation], like the subtractions below. In this case, the
//! relative comparison methods break down due to the relative ratio between values
//! being so high compared to their absolute difference:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use float_eq::{assert_float_eq, assert_float_ne};
//! assert_float_eq!(1.0_f32 - 1.0000001, 0.0, abs <= 0.0000002); // equal
//! assert_float_ne!(1.0_f32 - 1.0000001, 0.0, rel <= 0.0000002); // not equal
//! assert_float_ne!(1.0_f32 - 1.0000001, 0.0, ulps <= 1);        // not equal
//! ```
//!
//! Absolute epsilon comparisons:
//! - Are useful for checking if a float is equal to zero, especially if it has
//!   undergone an operation that suffers from [catastrophic cancellation] or is
//!   a [denormalised value] (a subnormal, in Rust terminology).
//! - Are almost certainly not what you want to use when testing [normal floats]
//!   for equality. `rel` and `ulps` checks can be easier to parameterise and
//!   reason about.
//!
//! ## Relative epsilon comparison
//!
//! A check to see how far apart two expressions are by comparing the absolute
//! difference between them to an epsilon that is scaled to the precision of the
//! larger input. Equivalent to, using `f32` as an example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn float_eq_rel(a: f32, b: f32, max_diff: f32) -> bool {
//!     let largest = a.abs().max(b.abs());
//!     (a - b).abs() <= (largest * max_diff)
//! }
//! # float_eq::assert_float_eq!(4_f32, 4.0000025, rel <= 0.0000006);
//! # assert!(float_eq_rel(4_f32, 4.0000025, 0.0000006));
//! ```
//!
//! This makes it suitable for general comparison of values where the ratio between
//! those values is relatively stable (e.g. [normal floats], excluding
//! infinity):
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use float_eq::{assert_float_eq, assert_float_ne};
//! let a = 1.0;
//! let b = 1.0000001; // the next representable value above 1.0
//! assert_float_eq!(a, b, rel <= 0.0000002);
//! assert_float_eq!(a * 4.0, b * 4.0, rel <= 0.0000002);
//! ```
//!
//! However, relative epsilon comparison becomes far too strict when the numbers
//! being checked are too close to zero, since the relative ratio between the values
//! can be huge whilst the absolute difference remains tiny. In these circumstances,
//! it is usually better to make an absolute epsilon check instead, especially if
//! your algorithm contains some form of [catastrophic cancellation], like these
//! subtractions:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use float_eq::{assert_float_eq, assert_float_ne};
//! assert_float_ne!(1.0_f32 - 1.0000001, 0.0, rel <= 0.0000002); // not equal
//! assert_float_eq!(1.0_f32 - 1.0000001, 0.0, abs <= 0.0000002); // equal
//! ```
//!
//! Relative epsilon comparisons:
//! - Are useful for checking if two [normal floats] are equal.
//! - Aren't a good choice when checking values against zero, where `abs` is often
//!   far better.
//!
//! ## Units in the Last Place (ULPs) comparison
//!
//! A check to see how far apart two expressions are by comparing the number of
//! discrete values that can be expressed between them. This works by interpreting
//! the bitwise representation of the input values as integers and comparing the
//! absolute difference between those. Equivalent to, using `f32` as an example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn float_eq_ulps(a: f32, b: f32, max_diff: u32) -> bool {
//!     // values are only comparable if they have the same sign
//!     if a.is_sign_positive() != b.is_sign_positive() {
//!         a == b // account for zero == negative zero
//!     } else {
//!         let a_bits = a.to_bits() as u32;
//!         let b_bits = b.to_bits() as u32;
//!         let max = a_bits.max(b_bits);
//!         let min = a_bits.min(b_bits);
//!         (max - min) <= max_diff
//!     }
//! }
//! # float_eq::assert_float_eq!(4_f32, 4.0000025, ulps <= 5);
//! # assert!(float_eq_ulps(4_f32, 4.0000025, 5));
//! ```
//!
//! Thanks to a deliberate quirk in the way the [underlying format] of IEEE floats
//! was designed, this is good measure of how near two values are that scales with
//! their relative precision:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use float_eq::{assert_float_eq, assert_float_ne};
//! assert_float_eq!(1.0_f32, 1.0000001, ulps <= 1);
//! assert_float_eq!(4.0_f32, 4.0000005, ulps <= 1);
//! assert_float_eq!(-1_000_000.0_f32, -1_000_000.06, ulps <= 1);
//! ```
//!
//! However, it becames far too strict when both expressions are close to zero,
//! since the relative difference between them can be very large, whilst the
//! absolute difference remains small. In these circumstances, it is usually better
//! to make an absolute epsilon check instead, especially if your algorithm contains
//! some form of [catastrophic cancellation], like these subtractions:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use float_eq::{assert_float_eq, assert_float_ne};
//! assert_float_ne!(1.0_f32 - 1.0000001, 0.0, ulps <= 1);        // not equal
//! assert_float_eq!(1.0_f32 - 1.0000001, 0.0, abs <= 0.0000002); // equal
//! ```
//!
//! ULPs based comparisons:
//! - Are useful for checking if two [normal floats] are equal.
//! - Aren't a good choice when checking values against zero, where `abs` is often
//!   far better.
//! - Provide a way to precisely tweak `max_diff` margins, since they have a 1-to-1
//!   correlation with the underlying representation.
//! - Have slightly counterintuitive results around powers of two values, where
//!   the relative precision ratio changes due to way the floating point exponent
//!   works.
//! - Do not work at all if the two values being checked have different signs.
//! - Do not respect the behaviour of special floating point values like NaN.
//!
//! # Comparing custom types
//!
//! Comparison of new types is supported by implementing [`FloatEq`]. If assert
//! support is required, then [`FloatDiff`] and [`FloatEqDebug`] should also be
//! implemented, as they provide important context information on failure.
